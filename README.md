**Abstract:** Research suggests that suicide can socially diffuse through social contexts, particularly in adolescence; however, little is known about the mechanisms that facilitate this diffusion. Using data from an in-depth case study of a community with a youth suicide problem (N=117), we examine how suicide became a more imaginable option for youth after repeated exposures in a socially-cohesive environment. Specifically, we found that the suicide deaths of high-status youth generated new locally-generalized meanings for suicide that reinterpreted broadly shared adolescent experiences (exposure to stress) as a cause of suicide. This facilitated youthâ€™s ability to imagine suicide as something someone like them could do to escape. We discuss the implications of our findings for (1) theories of social diffusion, which tend to neglect the important cultural processes embedded in networks, and (2) youth suicide prevention and public health. We also illustrate why multiple methodologies are necessary to advancing robust population health science.

<p class=footertext2>
**Anna S. Mueller** is a sociologist whose research examines how social relationships and social contexts shape adolescent health and wellbeing over the transition to adulthood. She is also interested in how schools, as social organizations, shape social relationships and opportunities to learn, thereby affecting the life chances of children. Her conceptual research interests are matched by her methodological interests in social network analysis, multi-level modeling, and in-depth qualitative case studies of adolescent societies.
